- Frontend is now in Angular
- Backend is in Python's Flask

## First time setup

If you don't alread have _NodeJS_ installed, do so [here](https://nodejs.org/en) (we use 18.18.1 LTS, but anything with version 18 should work). During the installation make sure you check this box:

Once _NodeJS_ is installed, in your terminal in the frontend folder run `npm install`.

Now the frontend should be good to go, read the README.md there for further info.
