# KWIP-2

A fork of the original [KWIP](https://github.com/KMNR/KWIP) with a different tech stack.

- Angular frontend
- Flask (Python) backend
- MySQL/MariaDB database

For more info or help, Carson Jones (aka DJCubed) would be happy to help: djcubed12@gmail.com.

## Quickstart commands

In `frontend/`: `npm run start`

In `backend/`: `pipenv run python3 app.py`

## First time setup

There are instruction documents for setting up KWIP for the first time in the `documentation` folder. Note that the instructions are different for Windows vs. Linux machines.

- [Windows setup](./documentation/windows-setup.md)
- [Linux setup](./documentation/linux-setup.md)
